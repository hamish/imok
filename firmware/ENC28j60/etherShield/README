etherShield Library for Arduino
===============================
This library provides Arduino support for the EtherShield from
nuelectronics. More information about the EtherShield is available at:

 http://www.nuelectronics.com/estore/?p=12


Installation
============
Download the ethershield library from:

 http://www.nuelectronics.com/download/projects/etherShield.zip

Unzip the library in your Arduino IDE library directory inside the
hardware directory of your Arduino installation. For example:

 arduino-0015/hardware/libraries/

There are six examples in the etherShield library. You may need to
change the IP address in the example sketch (.pde) files. The IP
address must be a free address with your network range.

  static uint8_t mymac[6] = {0x54,0x55,0x58,0x10,0x00,0x24};
  static uint8_t myip[4] = {192,168,1,15};
  static char baseurl[] = "http://192.168.1.15/";

Also you might like to change the webpage contents in the print_webpage
function. Note that the webpage contents are stored in the PROGMEM
(using PSTR declaration) to save precious SRAM space.


Library Structure
=================
The library is based on tuxgraphics.org's TCP/IP stack for the Atmega88
and ENC28J60. The main files in the library are:

 etherShield.cpp   Wrapper cpp file, as an Arduino library interface
                   with tuxgraphic's code

 ip_arp_udp_tcp.c  Simplified TCP/IP stack implementation

 enc28j60.c        ENC28J60 SPI routines

 net.h             Network protocol definitions


TCP/IP Implementation
=====================
The standard TCP is a protocl to establish a connection. To do this, a
number of packets needs to be exchaged between two sides first to
establish the connection; then data packets can be exchaged. Usually a
complicated state-machine is needed to implement the TCP protocol.

For Auduino's ATMEGA168, a 8-bit AVR microcontroller with 1K SRAM, it is
impossible to implement the full TCP stack. Also the webpage for 8-bit
microcontroller that normally is used to control a relay or read a
temperature sensor etc., is very simple. Therefore, instead of
implementing the full TCP protocol a single data packet TCP protocol is
used. Your webpage contents, including all html tags, must be in one
packet. The length of packet is limited by the SRAM size. Currently half
of the RAM space (500 bytes) is used for network Packet buffer which is
sufficient for simple webpages as shown in the examples.
